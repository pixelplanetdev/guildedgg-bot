# Basic guilded.gg Bot

This is just a test to run a bot on guilded.gg.
All guild and channel and user informations are being fetched.
But currently it just replies to a "ping" with "pong".

This porject will be obsolete as soon as guilded provides their own bot libraries.

## Building and Running

```
npm install
npm run Build
npm start -- email@mail.com yourguildedpassword
```
